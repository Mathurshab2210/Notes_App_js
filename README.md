# Notes_App_js
I have created a application in which you can store delete and save notes easily it is very user friendly , very easy to use. I have used only Html, CSS and JavaScript for this
You will get a Button fro deleting saving and adding note
I am using local storage function for storing the data 
You will get Auto save feature in it as well as one note is always there by default
